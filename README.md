I showed my friends my last bot and they were expecting an AI that automatically posts. I decided to give them what they wanted. 
# JUST_SAYIN (it's a bot)
Follows the top 1000 followed users then grabs the timeline and uses OpenAI to generate a fitting tweet. Plans to upgrade it and grab relevant media, maybe also limiting it's tweet pool more (removing tweets with @s, I've already remove retweets, etc.) once the following rate limit doesn't matter (a few days from initial commit).
